# FtYeet Plans
The temporary, privacy-centered file sharing system b/c if we don't have this, some intelligence agency in China's gonna be reading all text messages. <br>
Also because I need a quick way to transfer files between my VMs and I don't trust the ad-ridden site that is sendanywhere.com ü•∫ <br> <br>

* Prolly not a formal thing, but you know the PACELC Theorem?
    * Well I guess with encryption, there's a tradeoff between security and latency
    * `FtYeet` does not give a damn about latency (ok that's not true - getting DDOS'd is bad), but this very much prioritizes security
    * You're gonna see a lot of redundant things like "HMACs everywhere" "Double Encryption" "Hash those passwords twice" because I do not trust the end user to properly use `FtYeet`
* End to End Encryption (if the client chooses to do so) --> worst case, this gets downgraded to the regular ol' encryption that **most** companies should already be doing (looking at you AT&T üôÑ - isn't this like your 3rd data breach this year)
* CLI interface & Web interface
* Temporary file storage - eventually, files will get deleted

## Language Decision
Using `Node.js` because it does like 3 things at once for me <br>
God I love this language <br>
1. Standalone Client-Side executables
2. Decent Crypto support
3. Literally designed to build TCP Protocols and Web Servers

## Main Site Upload
* File upload
* 100mb max limit. If something's over 100mb, you probably shouldn't be sending it online   ---> Max 5 min
* 50mb max limit. Max 15 min
* If max size reached, prevent any file uploads temporarily.
* Encryption done browser/client side
* Toggle burn on read
* Possibly choose a password. Encryption done clientside; send over the password hash (if dummy user sends over a password, bruh that's on them. But this is getting hashed *again* so yk)
* Convience Toggle (we can give them a short URLCode that might be easy to brute force, or we can give them a long one for more security)
* When uploading, check database to make sure that URLCode isn't already occupied

## Main Site Download
* Might need to use clientside service worker
* Browser creates file write stream
* Decryption done client-side for end to end encryption

## Main Site 404
* "This file does not exist"
* I don't forsee anyone trying to pull off a replay attack or smth with this - but if they do, slap on a timestamp and have our server digitally sign this thing
* Also look into TCP reset attacks & stuff - although I think TLS would prevent against this because of timestamping, MACs, and the symmetric key exchange (can't replay attack if encryption is different)
* Also if TLS gets compromised, we have much bigger problems than a college kid trying to code an E2EE thing for fun (as in like the NSA and CISA starts running around while their building's on fire) ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Backup/2nd Encryption + Crypto Process
* Sometimes, users are dumb and won't send over an encrypted file
* In that case, encrypt them with server's public key. Store the private key somewhere safe and have a seperate process do the encrypting/decrypting stuff.
* --> if an attacker can get access to the private key stored in some privileged 
* Zero out the memory if possible bc memory forensics is scary (tbf if they get this far we're already cooked but still confidentiality >>> here)

## Private Key Encryption
* Do not give FtYeet permission to private key file (`chmod` such that `FtYeet` doesn't have perms to view this at all)
* Create a new privileged user with access to private key file
* User will serve as key vault (encrypt, decrypt, sign, etc.)
* IPC --> Maybe pipes if they could work; but prolly will just use an internal socket
* HTTPS Private Key != Actual private key used to encrypt/sign
* Second thought: Azure Key Vault but that'll require us trusting Azure (also it costs a bit more $$$ but it is an option)

## More on Symmetric Encryption + Key Generation
* Intrusive thought: Can't we just add a random timer to prevent side channel attacks
* Allow users to put in authentication codes (basically they serve to generate a MAC). If they don't, we'll use a different Key-Derivation function to generate an HMAC key
    * If one of the keys get compromised, the master key is still safe because of Key Derivation function
* SALT and IV can be transmitted with encrypted data (or included in the URL). Their job is to introduce randomness (and not act as a second authentication factor)

## Supported Ciphers
Huge shoutout to `https://soatok.blog/2020/05/13/why-aes-gcm-sucks/` and `https://soatok.blog/2020/07/12/comparison-of-symmetric-encryption-methods/#aes-gcm-vs-chacha20poly1305`
* `chacha20-poly1305` - This server is probably not running with Hardware Acceleration, so a built-in MAC + constant time processing is good
    * Also won't leak all your information, just sayin'
* `aes-256-gcm` - Authenticated AES-256. If you fundamentally distrust `HMAC + AES256-CBC` because a user can theoretically reuse keys, GCM is an option
* `aes-256-cbc` -  Doesn't completely flop if we accidentally reuse IVs unlike <a href="https://medium.com/asecuritysite-when-bob-met-alice/why-is-aes-gcm-good-and-not-so-good-for-cybersecurity-28b583bbbbd3">whatever's going on in GCM with GHashes</a> + Industry standard. We already use a CBC MAC for this so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Database
* Stores: URLCode, filePath, Hash of PwdHash/PubKey, expireTime, burnOnRead, HMAC-Entries
* Sort by expireTime
* Was thinking column level encryption but like the most sensitive thing is already hashed. Yay I guess you get a user's public key üò™ What are you gonna do with it? I don't really know
* On second thought, maybe we should encrypt everything except expireTime with the public key and then private key decrypt this when needed

## SQL Injection
* I really love MongoDB because it's much better at stopping SQLI than you know... SQL üôÑ
* But lowkey for this project, it might make more sense to boot up an SQL table
* If we do that:
    * Sanitize User Input using some library I find
    * Use parameterized queries (thank god we're using Node.js for this)
        * A bit weird since none of my SQLI textbooks mention this being a defense (they all just tell you to use prepared statements but like I can't really do that in this case)
        * According to the internet, it's a silver bullet to SQLI
        * We'll see if it worksd. Even if it doesn't, hopefully that input is sanitized by that library ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
        * Edit: Apparently we're worrying too much abt this because "Sanitize User input with a library" is apparently much better than what 75% of the companies out there do

## Encrypted files
* The sent file can be in any format the user desires
    * Although the default CLI command will use a HMAC for symmetric key
    * For asymmetric encryption, the hash will be a DSA (check `Node:Crypto` to see what they support)
* Serverside: [HMAC / DSA].[Encrypted File Content]
* Encrypt the already encrypted file again! Use the password hash or public key. 
* This means if a dummy user decides to not upload an encrypted file or not give us an actual password hash, they still benefit from good ol' security
* And if they do, tada! End to end üòé

## Automatic Burn
* Spawn a child process that does this
    * Scans db every minute
* I do NOT want the main code to be doing any deleting - and also because I have a feeling stuff might crash when we delete them
* Send heartbeat pulses to the child process to ensure it didn't die
    * Something something crash stop failures bad ü§î I took distributed and every time you spawn a process, this word gets repeated like 50 times
    * Recovery should be pretty simple - we have a database that kind of tells you what's expired and what you need to delete
* Zero out the memory if we can find a way to do that

## FtYeet Protocol
* TCP Port 4000 (don't worry the server will not be running Diablo 2)
* Provide CLI to interact with this thing
* Protocol to upload:
```
    server                  client
    <---------------- ClientHello upload [enc alg] [time in minutes] [burnOnRead]

    [
        Potentially Authenticate for user:
        -----------------> Challenge (encrypted w/ pub key. I know we're stealing stuff from SSH shush)
        <----------------- Answer 
    ]

    ACK ---------------------->
    <---------------- Encrypted file (done clientside)
    PASSWD / PUBKEY -----------------> 
    <---------------- Password Hash or Public key
    URLCode ------------------->
```
* Protocol to retrieve:
```
    server                  client
    <---------------- ClientHello retrieve [URLCode]

    [
        Potentially Authenticate for user:
        -----------------> Challenge (encrypted w/ pub key. I know we're stealing stuff from SSH shush)
        <----------------- Answer 
    ]

    [
        If password:
        PASSWD ------------->
        <------------------- Password Hash
    ]

    [
        If encrypted asymmetrically:
        -----------------> Challenge (encrypted w/ pub key. I know we're stealing stuff from SSH shush)
        <----------------- Answer 
    ]
    -----------------> Encrypted file (decryption done clientside)
```
* This makes way more sense when you realize that we're encrypting the files twice
    

## Main Site Authenticate
* Insert password
* If it's a public/private key thing, tell them that private/public key encryption isn't currently supported
* Public facing - for private user accounts, you'll need to register through CLI (although this would be limited to only people i trust)

## File System Security
* Disable execution on all files
* Potentially containerize/hide stuff in a seperate "virtual file system" to isolate from main file system
* --> not too sure how to do that; but if `Hadoop` fs could pull something like that together so can we
* Track total size

## Future Plans
* Prevent bots from abusing file upload (we only have so much space)
* Get TLS (certbot for website *if* we can have a domain name --> some self-signed stuff might work temporarily; need to think of how to do it for the FTYeet Protocol)
* Private key rotation daemon on server
* üö® Lowkey thinking of just flat out not giving users permission to upload a file without a password because c'mon dude at that point why even bother 
* 2FA? Lowkey this is probably overkill
* Node.js stand alone executables
